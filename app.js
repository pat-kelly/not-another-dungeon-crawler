TODOO - Everything, duh.
  * character object
    - to include player, npcs?, monsters, etc.
    - Stats:
      - Health
      - Magic
      - str, dex, etc. (might be too much)
    - Inventory
      - Money, items, etc.
    - status(es)
    - location & facing
  * Location object
    - internal map (maybe? might just be one screen deals)
    - external 'door' location
    - what direction the door faces in the overworld
  * Map and where everything is.
    - Maybe each character/room/event/thing has a 'location' value? ie: tavern is at [5][3]
    - 2d array? and keep everything set in a grid.
    - [0][0] [1][0] [2][0]
    - [0][1] [1][1] [2][1]  <-- This kind of thing
    - [0][2] [1][2] [2][2]
    ? keep a log of where the player has been, and use that as a viewable 'map'?
  *moar to come.
